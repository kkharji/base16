# Base16 Konsole

This is a [base16 template repository][tr] for konsole.  Currently it includes two templates and corresponding output folders.

## colorscheme-vim

The files in `colorscheme-vim` are designed to be compatible with [base16-vim][bv].  The means the "intense" colors (8-15) have been repurposed (similarly to [iterm2/dark.itermcolors.erb][itermtempl]) to provide shades of grey and yellow colors needed for a good looking vim interface.  Normally [ansi 9 looks red][wikicolors], but instead it's mapped to *base03* (grey) for base16-vim.  To make the vim colorscheme compatible with this mapping, you must leave `base16colorspace` unset in `.vimrc`.  Other applications like prompts and `ls` **will look off** as a consequence - although this can be mitigated as described below.

## colorscheme

The files in `colorscheme` will *not* work with [base16-vim][bv], but colors will show up correctly in prompts and the colored output of `ls`.

# Installation

To install system-wide, copy the desired files (not the folder) into the appropriate folder.  You can download and install only one file if you know what theme you want to use.

KDE Version | Available To |Location
------------|--------------|-----------------------
KDE 5       | System Wide  | `/usr/share/konsole`
KDE 5       | User Only    | `~/.local/share/konsole`
KDE 4       | System Wide  | `/usr/share/kde4/apps/konsole`
KDE 4       | User Only    | `~/.kde4/apps/konsole/`

NOTE: For `*.schema` files designed to work with the version of konsole included with KDE3, see [base16-konsole-kde3][kde3].

You must restart konsole, then you can select the theme you would like to use through the menus.

## Vim Configuration

Follow the instructions for [installation of base16-vim][bvi].  **Do not set base16colorspace!**

### Airline

In RHEL6, vim shows my airline status with bright yellow forground colors instead of darker colors.  It's using `ctermfg=10`, but 10 seems to be set correctly.  I'm not sure why, but changing term=bold to term=NONE fixes the issue.  The easiest way to do this is to remove `bold` from the string value on [this line][airline-bold].

[airline-bold]: https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline/blob/45d77ca90953e191e4ac140b964683c2aecef069/autoload/airline/themes.vim#L51

### junegunn/fzf

If you use [fzf][fzf] and want colorization to look right, you'll need something like this in your `.bashrc`.

```sh
if [[ $TERM =~ konsole.* ]]; then
    export FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS='--color fg+:5,hl+:6'
fi
```

This is due to fzf using intense versions of colors.  Since most are dark, the selected item winds up being hard to see.  With `FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS` as mentioned, the selected item will be white and matching text will be orange.  Those are the only good colors to use.

[fzf]: https://github.com/junegunn/fzf

### ls colorization

With kde4-konsole-vim, `ls --color` shows many items in a dark color that is hard to see.  To correct this, you need to set the `LS_COLORS` environment variable to not use bright intensity colors.  You can do this most easily with `dircolors`.  See the [dir_colors manpage][dir_colors] for additional details.  The process for removing intensity code (01) from `LS_COLORS` is:

1. Copy /etc/DIR_COLORS to ~/.dir_colors
1. Edit ~/.dir_colors and modify entries to remove `01;`.  For example, `DIR 01;34` should become, `DIR 34`.
1. Logout and log back in, or run `eval $(dircolors ~/.dir_colors)`

A [base16-vim compatible file][dcgist] is available for you to download if you don't need any further customization.

```sh
cd ~
curl -OL https://gist.githubusercontent.com/cskeeters/aacd10c075d3c7092a5e4e36db34e62d/raw/.dir_colors
```

### Mercurial Configuration

If you use the [color extension][hgc] for hg, you'll need to customize the colors so that bold is not used.  Add this to your `~/.hgrc`.

    [color]
    status.modified = blue
    status.added = green
    status.removed = red
    status.deleted = cyan
    status.unknown = magenta
    status.ignored = yellow

    diff.extended = cyan
    diff.file_a = red
    diff.file_b = green
    diff.trailingwhitespace = red_background

    qseries.applied = blue underline
    qseries.unapplied = yellow
    qseries.missing = red

### Advanced Configuration

If you are like me and want a single `.vimrc` to function for konsole (in 16 color mode) and another terminal which supports 256 colors, you can configure konsole's environment to set `TERM=konsole` and then only set base16colorspace when TERM does not start with konsole

```vim
if $TERM !~# "konsole.*"
    " As a work around for the following bugs in kde4's konsole:
    "   use the output of 16.colorscheme.rb and don't set base16colorspace.
    "   base-shell script will not be called
    " https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-shell/issues/31
    " https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=344181
    let base16colorspace=256
endif
```

# Technical Details

ANSI colors can be set in a terminal in two ways.

1. Using the menus to load some settings file, or through `.Xresources`.
2. Set by sending ANSI operating system commands to the terminal.

If

* bright colors (8-15) are set to the same or similar color with the standard ansi colors (0-7),
* Colors 16-20 are set using either method above to dark/orange colors.
* `let base16colorspace=256` is set in `.vimrc`

then everything works great.

Unfortunately, most terminal's only allow you to set colors 0-15.  Konsole is no exception.  Since konsole [doesn't support xterm's operating system command to set those colors][konbug] (ala base16-shell), there is no point in using it and base16-vim can not operate in a 256 colorspace.  Fortunately, base16-vim can function with base16colorspace not set if the black and orange characters are set in colors 8-15.  This template repository provides colorscheme files where colors 8-15 have the black/orange colors needed.

Fortunately, base16-vim is designed to be able to To use vim with vim-base16 in konsole, we must use this 16-color pallet version  and be sure to NOT set base16colorspace=256 in vimrc.


## Further reading/references on ANSI codes

For those interested, you can check out the spec [xterm's documentation on operating system commands][osc]:

```text
    OSC    Ps   ;    Pt                             ST
    ESC ]  4    ;    <ColorNumber> ; rgb:FF/00/00   ESC \
````

Under *Ps = 4*, you can read.

> This can be a name or RGB specification as per XParseColor.

[man 3 xparsecolor][xpc] shows under *Color Names* supporting the `rgb:<red>/<green>/<blue>` format.

base16-shell uses this corresponding template to set the color:

    printf_template='\033]4;%d;rgb:%s\033\\'
