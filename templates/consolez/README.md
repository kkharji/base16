# Base16 ConsoleZ

Supports [ConsoleZ](https://github.com/cbucher/console), focused on integrated usage with [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com).

See the [Base16 repository](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16) for more information.

This theme was built with [Base16 Builder Ruby](https://github.com/obahareth/base16-builder-ruby).

## Installation

Select one of the many color schemes available for [base16](http://chriskempson.com/projects/base16), look for the corresponding XML file in the colors folder and **merge** that with your `console.xml`. This means, that you should keep all existing attributes from your current `console.xml` and just replace the values for `r`, `g`, and `b` for the various colors.

Note, that if you would like to use opacity and/or a background image while still using a Base16 color-scheme, you can do so. For this, simply use the above described `console.xml`, and _afterwards_ setup the opacity/background image.
