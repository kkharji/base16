# base16-fzf

This repository provides [base16][1] color schemes for [fzf][2], a
command-line fuzzy finder written in Go.

It is meant to be used along with the [new implementation][1] of the
base16 color scheme project, which proposes a modular approach by
separating templates, schemes and builder into different repositories.

Themes in base16-fzf work by appending `--color` options to your
existing `FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS` environment variable.

## Installation

### Bash & Zsh

Source your favorite base16 color scheme from the `bash` directory into
your bash or zsh configuration file. The generated `bash` scripts append
`--color` options naively to your `FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS` environment
variable.

### Fish

Source your favorite base16 color scheme from the `fish` directory with
the `source` command. This creates a global variable that will be
persistent across shell sessions. The generated `fish` scripts will
overwrite existing `--color` options from your existing
`FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS` to stop it from growing indefinitely as you try out
different color schemes.

The themes are built using [base16-builder-go][4].
