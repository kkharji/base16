# base16-i3status

This is a repository that provides a [base16](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16) template to generate theme
settings for [i3status](https://github.com/i3/i3status).

To use, just pick a config snippet from colors/ and put it in your i3status configuration, however you want.

The 3 colors mapping is based on [xresources](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-xresources) base16 color1, color2 and color 3 mapping. The colors should be similar to terminals.
