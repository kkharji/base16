At this point you're waiting on us. We like to at least comment on pull requests

Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted:

- Write tests.
- Follow the commit-style below.

## Commit Style

A sample **good commit** is:

```
fileName: Thing I did
Some subHeading things

So this change was to do that thing I thought was good. Also there was this
other person who thought so too, so then I ate a sandwich and we got the code
done. I am writing this but really, honestly, two people did this.


Co-authored-by: Joel Doe <joel@iexistreally.com>
```

As is evident, the commit should clearly have:

- The name of the file, or the topic or the subject you have changed or the
  namespace or the functionality you have added **something:**
- A line describing **something:**
- An _(optional)_ subheading with more details
- An _(optional)_ paragraph or essay on why the change was done and anything else you want to share with the devs.
- **Co-authorship** IS MANDATORY if applicable. Even if you just had a sandwich with the other person. It won't kill you to share, or to write that.
