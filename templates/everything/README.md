# base16-everything

[Base16](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16) color schemes for [Everything](https://www.voidtools.com/)

Mostly cosmetical, as there are practically just two colors used by the tool.

## Installation

* Close Everything
* Copy contents of one of the `.ini` files and append it to `Everything.ini` file (the one that stores user settings, check Everything options to find it)
* Start Everything
